README: About the English dictionary.

The English dictionary has been elaborated by
    Juan L. Varona
    

This dictionary and the collection of words that it contains can be
distributed, modified or not, with no restriction, provided a
reference is made to the author and also to this description
(modified is necessary to point the changes made in the
dictionary). Also, it may be used in conjunction with any other
program, commercial or otherwise, with just two conditions:
    (1) The origin of the dictionary should be recognized in a
visible place of the program itself or the manual.
    (2) A certificate should be submitted to the author by ordinary
mail indicating that this collection of words is being used in
conjunction with the program.

These conditions have only curricular purposes and of
acknowledgment to the author's work. They will also allow him to
find out if it has been useful elsewhere. I have spent quite a lot
of time in compiling this dictionary and would be pleased to know
that it has not been a wasted time.
